# Waleed Khamies – Applied Research Scientist

I am an **Applied Research Scientist at [NTWIST](https://ntwist.com)**. My research focuses on developing secure, efficient AI systems, with particular interest in **reinforcement learning**, **self-supervised learning**, and **optimization-based methods** for real-world automation and decision-making problems.

Previously, I worked as a **Research Engineer Intern at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/)** under the supervision of [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/), where I contributed to deep learning research for robotics in noisy and partially observable environments.

I completed my Master’s in Mathematical Sciences with a specialization in Machine Learning at [AMMI – African Master’s in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), focusing on interpretability in reinforcement learning under [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). I also hold a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/en), where I worked with [Benjamin Rosman](https://www.benjaminrosman.com/).
