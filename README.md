# **Waleed Khamies – Applied Research Scientist**

I am an **Applied Research Scientist at [NTWIST](https://ntwist.com)**, where I focus on building secure and efficient AI systems. My core interests lie in **reinforcement learning**, **self-supervised learning**, and **optimization-based approaches** to real-world automation and decision-making challenges.

Previously, I was a **Research Engineer Intern at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/)**, working under the supervision of [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/) on deep learning for robotics in uncertain and partially observable environments.

I hold a Master’s in Mathematical Sciences with a focus on Machine Learning from [AMMI – African Master’s in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), where I conducted research on reinforcement learning interpretability with [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). I also earned a Bachelor’s in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/en), with research collaboration under [Benjamin Rosman](https://www.benjaminrosman.com/).
