# Waleed Khamies – Applied Research Scientist

I am an **Applied Machine Learning Scientist at [NTWIST](https://ntwist.com)** and a researcher at the [University of Alberta](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/khamies), where I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, optimization, and real-world systems. My current focus includes building intelligent schedulers and automation tools for the manufacturing industry using reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and constraint optimization.

Previously, I worked as a **Research Engineer Intern at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/)** under the supervision of [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/), contributing to research on deep learning for robotics in uncertain and noisy environments. I completed my Master’s in Mathematical Sciences with a specialization in Machine Learning at the [African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org/), where I focused on interpretability in reinforcement learning under the supervision of [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/en), where I conducted research under the guidance of [Benjamin Rosman](https://www.benjaminrosman.com/).
